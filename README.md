# A2ASandbox

A repo of experiments, samples, tutorials, etc. related to working with the A2A protocol.

## Samples

* [helloworld](./helloworld/) -- Super simple "client" and "server" Agents in Java, where the "server" is just  hardcoded to return "Hello, World" to any incoming request.
* [helloworld2](./helloworld2/) -- "Client" and "server" agents in Java, where the "server" sends the incoming message to the configured LLM client and then returns the response generated by the LLM.
* [helloworld3](./helloworld3/) -- Same as first helloworld example, but with both "client" and "server" Agents written in Python
* [helloworld4](./helloworld4/) -- Same as second helloworld example, but with both "client" and "server" Agents written in Python
* Java server / Python client example
* Python server/ Java client example
* More complex examples...
* TBD
